# Generator-Project
## Description
Create a project using code that generates an "Object".
You can use any software for the generation, as long as you are creating the code that generates the "Object". 
Note: If you generate groups, then the group is your object.
The object should have 'edges', and not be infinite. You can make a system that generates a 'near infinite' quantity of things, but you should be able to generate one object at a time. 

## Requirements
- The generator should be able to make thousands or more variations of this "Object". [30 points]
- It should also be at least partially guided by user input. [30 points]

     *This can mean inputting a seed, clicking to choose position, keys for changing parameter thresholds, letting people change grammars, or more.*
- Share your 'a priori' artifact, the object you used as the basis of your generator [10 points]

Lastly, choose one of these additional challenges: [20 points]
- Generation of the next "Object" is based on the last one generated (how do you solve for the first one?)
- Create a way to easily share the created Object with others (tweet, Discord post, TikTok, link, etc)
    - Examples: adding a button to post to social media, generate a link with an id that opens to those parameters & seeds, generating an image that includes details on how to create more (like a watermark)
- Use more than one Seed at a time for your generation system and let users manipulate them

Your generator appears to have a Quality [10 points]
   Your project shows a certain level of focus and creativity that is indescribable but shows a level of quality above your peers.
